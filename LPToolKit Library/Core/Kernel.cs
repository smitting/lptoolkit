    /// This is a new experiment that may not go well.
    /// 
    /// This is a kernel in the operating system sense of the word.  
    /// Instead of having each thread with the unlimited ability to
    /// pass events to the implants, this kernel controls the processing
    /// of all events using the following steps:
    ///     - recieve raw events from subsystems and hardware drivers
    ///     - convert these events to ImplantEvents
    ///     - pass the ImplantEvents to implants
    ///     - all API calls generate ImplantAction objects passed to this object
    ///     - ImplantActions are converted into raw events 
    ///     - Raw events are passed back to subsystems and hardware drivers
    ///     
    /// The goals of this kernal:
    ///     - provide consistency in latency of event processing
    ///     - ability to prioritize events
    ///     - have events that affect audio managed in real time
    ///     - manages best utilization of multiple processors
    ///     
    /// Details:
    ///     - even web calls should be managed to prevent overloading the audio systems (maybe should be a separate process instead?)
    ///     
    /// It's possible this effort will be worthless, but our output has
    /// been far too inconsistent to date for live performances when 
    /// providing MIDI note data instead of just turning knobs.
