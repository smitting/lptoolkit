LPToolKit (open source Midi Symbiont)
=========

LPToolKit is the open source engine for the future commercial application MidiSymbiont, which allows multiple MIDI devices such as the Novation LaunchPad and LaunchControl to work together by using javascript to create "implants".  More details on MidiSymbiont are available at http://www.midisymbiont.com/ including programming reference for implants.

The entire engine for MidiSymbiont is intended to remain open source to encourage use of implants in other software.  My goal is to expand the use of implants as wide as possible, MidiSymbiont is only being released commercially so as to fund purchasing more gear to make more drivers.

CAUTION - THIS SOFTWARE IS CURRENTLY IN AN EARLY ALPHA STATE AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO API CHANGES.

If you still want to use the software, the ImplantConsole application is what you will want to build.  This is a simple console application that is controlled via an embedded web server.  It launches its settings web page in your default web browser upon launching.
